# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-12-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to record significant architectural decisions made during the development of `mpmc-queue` to preserve context for future contributors and maintainers.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document these decisions. We will follow a lightweight format including Context, Decision, Status, and Consequences.

## Consequences

*   **Positive**: Clear history of design choices, easier onboarding for new developers.
*   **Negative**: Slight overhead in maintaining documentation.
